-- These are just the *rough* queries for our functional requirements (plus one more). They should not be marked or copied into the query box, as they were changed for the final implementation


-- Q1: show all the information for all drivers associated with a particular rescue organization

SELECT *
FROM Driver
WHERE rescueOrgID = $rescueOrganizationID


-- Q2: for a particular donor, show which organizations they donated to and the total amount donated (over their lifetime)

SELECT
	organizationName,
	SUM(valueDonated) AS totalDonated
FROM donatesTo JOIN organization
WHERE orgPhoneNumber = phoneNumber AND (donorFirstName = $firstName AND donorLastName = $lastName)
GROUP BY orgPhoneNumber


-- Q3: show the total amount donated for 2018 to a selected organization

SELECT
	organizationName,
	SUM(valueDonated) AS totalDonated
FROM donatesTo JOIN organization
WHERE organizationName = $orgName AND orgPhoneNumber = phoneNumber AND year(dateDonated) = 2018
group by orgPhoneNumber


-- Q4: show the animals that went from the SPCA directly to a shelter (ie. they did not go through the rescue organization)

SELECT
	animalID,
	origin AS originSPCA,
	destination AS destinationShelter
FROM animalTransport
WHERE (origin IN (SELECT phoneNumber FROM spcaBranch))
AND (destination IN (SELECT phoneNumber FROM shelter))


-- Q5: show how many animals were rescued during 2018 (by any rescue organization)

SELECT
	animalID,
	destination AS rescuer
FROM animalTransport
WHERE destination IN (SELECT phoneNumber FROM rescueOrganization)
AND year(transportDate) = 2018
